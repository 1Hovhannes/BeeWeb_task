# TASK FOR FULL STACK JS


1. Login/ signup with firebase
2. After login user should be redirected to dashboard.
3. Dashboard will show a container where user can create dynamic text blocks using
Slate.js (Have a “plus” button on top, when user clicks on it, just show a text block in
container)
4. The user must be able to sort those dynamic text blocks, also be able to have
multiple blocks in one line. (like in https://www.notion.so/)


## Technology stack:

Front - React/Redux, redux saga or thunk, Ant design, Slate.js
Backend - Firebase
